//! This crate provides a simple type, `StaticSlot<T>`, which is designed to make it easy to use static variables
//! without much boilerplate or overhead. Usually you do not need any type of global variable, as it can introduce a
//! number of problems into your code with bugs and testability. That being said, in certain applications a global
//! variable is the most practical or efficient solution. This crate is targeted toward these uses.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! A static slot is just a nullable pointer to some heap-allocated value with some extra features. We can declare one
//! like this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use staticslot::StaticSlot;
//!
//! static MY_SLOT: StaticSlot<i32> = StaticSlot::EMPTY;
//! ```
//!
//! Here we're defining a static variable of type `StaticSlot<i32>` and initializing it to `StaticSlot::EMPTY`. In this
//! state, our slot will start out "empty". To put an `i32` value into the slot we can use the `set()` method:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use staticslot::StaticSlot;
//!
//! static MY_SLOT: StaticSlot<i32> = StaticSlot::EMPTY;
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     MY_SLOT.set(42);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! There are two things we can observe from this. First, we can set the value without having `MY_SLOT` be `static mut`.
//! This is because the slot provides atomic, interior mutability for us. Secondly, calling `set()` is unsafe; this is
//! because the compiler cannot guarantee we will free the memory for our `i32` when we are done with it.
//!
//! If the value has been set, we can access it later using `get()`:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use staticslot::StaticSlot;
//!
//! static MY_SLOT: StaticSlot<i32> = StaticSlot::EMPTY;
//!
//! unsafe {
//!     MY_SLOT.set(42);
//! }
//! println!("{}", *MY_SLOT.get().unwrap() + 100);
//! ```
//!
//! Since the slot may be empty, `get()` returns an `Option`. To clean up the memory when you are done, you can make the
//! slot empty again by calling the `drop()` method. If you want to avoid unsafe code, you can put a dynamic lifetime on
//! the value in the slot using the `with()` method, which introduces a scope for the value:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use staticslot::StaticSlot;
//!
//! static MY_SLOT: StaticSlot<i32> = StaticSlot::EMPTY;
//!
//! assert!(MY_SLOT.get() == None);
//! MY_SLOT.with(42, || {
//!     // MY_SLOT contains 42 inside this block.
//!     assert!(MY_SLOT.get() == Some(&mut 42));
//! });
//! assert!(MY_SLOT.get() == None);
//! ```
//!
//! If there is already a value in the slot, the previous value is restored at the end of the scope. Using `with()`
//! guarantees that the memory for the value is cleaned up, and also allows you to nest calls with different values in
//! the slot.
//!
//! # Unsized types
//!
//! Since `StaticSlot` depends on atomic operations, only `Sized` types can be stored in it, as unsized types would
//! require double-word atomics, which are not available on most architectures. It is possible to have an atomic unsized
//! pointer by having a double pointer, but that would harm the performance for the general case.
//!
//! If you need an unsized static slot (to hold a trait object, for example), you can simply put a `Box<T>` in the slot
//! to get the desired semantics. Below is an example of putting `Any` into a static slot.
//!
//! ```rust
//! use staticslot::StaticSlot;
//! use std::any::Any;
//! use std::sync::Mutex;
//!
//! static ANY: StaticSlot<Mutex<Box<Any + Send>>> = StaticSlot::EMPTY;
//!
//! let value = Mutex::new(Box::new(String::from("hello")) as Box<Any + Send>);
//!
//! ANY.with(value, || {
//!     if let Some(mutex) = ANY.get() {
//!         if let Some(string) = mutex.lock().unwrap().downcast_ref::<String>() {
//!             println!("It's a string({}): '{}'", string.len(), string);
//!         }
//!     }
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! This is useful when you need a singleton instance of some trait, but the implementation can vary.
